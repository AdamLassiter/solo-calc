One encoding gives a strong correspondence but uses a match operator; the other yields a slightly weaker correspondence but uses no additional operators.",

	abstract="We address the problems of implementing the replication operator efficiently in the solos calculus --- a calculus of mobile processes without prefix. This calculus is expressive enough to admit an encoding of the whole fusion calculus and thus the $\pi$-calculus. We show that nested occurrences of replication can be avoided, that the size of replicated terms can be limited to three particles, and that the usual unfolding semantics of replication can be replaced by three simple reduction rules. To illustrate the results and show how the calculus can be efficiently implemented we present a graphic representation of agents in the solos calculus, adapting ideas from interaction diagrams and pi-nets.",
