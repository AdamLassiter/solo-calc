    abstract = "In the study of process calculi, encoding between different calculi is an effective way to compare the expressive power of calculi and can shed light on the essence of where the difference lies. Thomsen and Sangiorgi have worked on the higher-order calculi (higher-order Calculus of Communicating Systems (CCS) and higher-order π-calculus, respectively) and the encoding from and to first-order π-calculus. However a fully abstract encoding of first-order π-calculus with higher-order CCS is not available up-today. This is what we intend to settle in this paper. We follow the encoding strategy, first proposed by Thomsen, of translating first-order π-calculus into Plain CHOCS. We show that the encoding strategy is fully abstract with respect to early bisimilarity (first-order π-calculus) and wired bisimilarity (Plain CHOCS) (which is a bisimulation defined on wired processes only sending and receiving wires), that is the core of the encoding strategy. Moreover from the fact that the wired bisimilarity is contained by the well-established context bisimilarity, we secure the soundness of the encoding, with respect to early bisimilarity and context bisimilarity. We use index technique to get around all the technical details to reach these main results of this paper. Finally, we make some discussion on our work and suggest some future work.",

    abstract = "We present the fusion calculus as a significant step towards a canonical calculus of concurrency. It simplifies and extends the /spl pi/-calculus. The fusion calculus contains the polyadic /spl pi/-calculus as a proper subcalculus and thus inherits all its expressive power. The gain is that fusion contains actions akin to updating a shared state, and a scoping construct for bounding their effects. Therefore it is easier to represent computational models such as concurrent constraints formalisms. It is also easy to represent the so called strong reduction strategies in the /spl lambda/-calculus, involving reduction under abstraction. In the /spl lambda/-calculus these tasks require elaborate encodings. Our results on the fusion calculus in this paper are the following. We give a structured operational semantics in the traditional style. The novelty lies in a new kind of action, fusion actions for emulating updates of a shared state. We prove that the calculus contains the /spl pi/-calculus as a subcalculus. We define and motivate the bisimulation equivalence and prove a simple characterization of its induced congruence, which is given two versions of a complete axiomatization for finite terms. The expressive power of the calculus is demonstrated by giving a straight-forward encoding of the strong lazy /spl lambda/-calculus, which admits reduction under /spl lambda/ abstraction.",

To this end, we first give a a new, congruence-free presentation of the Fusion calculus; then, the behaviour endofunctor is constructed by adding in a systematic way a notion of “state” to the intuitive endofunctor induced by the LTS. Coalgebras can be given a concrete presentation as “stateful indexed labelled transition systems”; the bisimilarity over these systems is a congruence, and corresponds to hyperequivalence. Then, we model the labelled transition system of Fusion by abstract categorical rules. As a consequence, we get a semantics for the Fusion calculus which is both compositional and fully abstract: two processes have the same semantics iff they are bisimilar, that is, hyperequivalent.",

In particular, the induced solo diagrams bear an acyclicity property that induces a faithful encoding into differential interaction nets. This gives a (new) proof that differential interaction nets are expressive enough to contain an encoding of the pi-calculus. All this is worked out in the case of finitary (replication free) systems without sum, match nor mismatch.",

    learning-styles,
    issn = "0747-5632",
    abstract = "Student modelling is an important process for adaptive virtual learning environments. Student models include a range of information about the learners such as their domain competence, learning style or cognitive traits. To be able to adapt to the learners’ needs in an appropriate way, a reliable student model is necessary, but getting enough information about a learner is quite challenging. Therefore, mechanisms are needed to support the detection process of the required information. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between learning styles, in particular, those pertaining to the Felder–Silverman learning style model and working memory capacity, one of the cognitive traits included in the cognitive trait model. The identified relationship is derived from links between learning styles, cognitive styles, and working memory capacity which are based on studies from the literature. As a result, we demonstrate that learners with high working memory capacity tend to prefer a reflective, intuitive, and sequential learning style whereas learners with low working memory capacity tend to prefer an active, sensing, visual, and global learning style. This interaction can be used to improve the student model. Systems which are able to detect either only cognitive traits or only learning styles retrieve additional information through the identified relationship. Otherwise, for systems that already incorporate learning styles and cognitive traits, the interaction can be used to improve the detection process of both by including the additional information of a learning style into the detection process of cognitive traits and vice versa. This leads to a more reliable student model.",
