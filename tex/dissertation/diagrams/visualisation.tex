\subsection{Visualiser and REST Server}\label{ssec:rest-server}

    \subsubsection{Overview and Analysis}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The visualisation of diagrams was done using force-directed graphs.
            \item There was a communication channel between a back-end reduction engine and front-end diagram viewer.
            \item REST server and PUSH/PUT/GET requests to the back-end prompted a response of a diagram reduction.
            \item The returned object was then parsed to an SVG.
            \item Nodes were tracked through reductions --- those not reduced inherited their position from the previous diagram, enforcing smoothness.
            \item Various colours were applied to nodes depending upon their position relative to boxes (internal, perimeter, external).
            \item Problems with nodes on perimeter of boxes --- as diagrams are defined as a collection  of edges, perimeter nodes are both internal and external nodes to a box.
        \end{itemize}
