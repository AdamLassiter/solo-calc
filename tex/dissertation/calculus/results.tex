\subsection{Method and Results}
    The implementation here was divided into three parts: objects and functions, read-eval-print-loop (REPL) interface and a representational state transfer (REST) server.
    The former handles reduction strategies, string formatting of terms and the underlying data structure.
    The REPL handles user input and output, wrapping the objects and functions in a human-useable manner.
    The REST server then presents a computer-useable interface for reduction of calculus terms, as well as allowing input through the aforementioned REPL.
    The REST server alone serves no purpose, but combined with the diagram visualiser completes the program and allows for visualising inputted calculus terms as diagrams.
