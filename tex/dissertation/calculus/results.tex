The implementation here was divided into two parts: a collection of objects and functions and a read-eval-print-loop (REPL) interface.
The former handles reduction strategies, string formatting of terms and the underlying data structure.
The latter handles user input and output, wrapping the objects and functions in a human-useable manner.
