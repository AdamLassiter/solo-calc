        The project seeks to provide an implementation of both the Solo Calculus and also of Solo Diagrams, an intuitively graphical representation of the calculus.
        These diagrams can then aid in understanding of reductions of process calculi, while maintaining a clean and simple language with strong provable properties.

    \begin{abstract}
        Before you lies the culmination of a year's work on the weird and wonderful Solo Calculus.
        Written in support of MComp Computer Science with Mathematics degree at University of Bath, it has been a joy to see the project come to life throughout the last eight months.
        I hope the realisations and results found within offer the same new perspective on the workings of an implemented process calculus as they have given me.\\

        I would like to express my gratitude to Prof. Guy McCusker for his guidance and dedicated supervision of this project throughout.
        Further thanks are extended to my mother, whose constant support and advice on the politics and practices of academic writing have proven invaluable.

        Happy reading,\\

        Adam Lassiter

        The Solo Calculus is found to be simple, expressive and remarkable in its capability to be visualised as a diagram.
        For further reading,~\cite{acyclic-solos} present in great detail the topics of the $\pi$- and Solo Calculus, Solo Diagrams and furthermore differential interaction nets.
