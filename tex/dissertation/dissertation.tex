    \begin{abstract}
        The project seeks to provide an implementation of both the Solos calculus, for which there exists an encoding of the $\pi$-calculus within itself, and also of Solos diagrams, an intuitively graphical representation of the calculus. These diagrams can then aid in understanding of reductions of process calculi, while maintaining a clean and simple language with strong provable properties.
        Furthermore, the design of the Solos calculus is such that it is fully asynchronous. That is, unlike in the $\pi$-calculus where processes `block' while waiting for inputs/outputs, it is shown through the construction of the Solos calculus that no such system is required --- however there still exists a way of building such a system to give the effects of the $\pi$-calculus should it be desired.
        For these reasons, the Solos calculus is found to be an interesting alternative to the more common $\pi$-calculus and is therefore chosen as the project focus.
