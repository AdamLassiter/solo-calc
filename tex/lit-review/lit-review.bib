    lambda-calculus,
    abstract="Lambda calculus is a formal system built around the concepts of function definition and function application. It is a minimalistic Turing-computable system that has a great influence on the design of functional programming. This paper is a tutorial on the untyped lambda calculus and its use as an idealised programming language.",

One encoding gives a strong correspondence but uses a match operator; the other yields a slightly weaker correspondence but uses no additional operators.",

    abstract="We present a restriction of the solos calculus which is stable under reduction and expressive enough to contain an encoding of the pi-calculus. As a consequence, it is shown that equalizing names that are already equal is not required by the encoding of the pi-calculus. In particular, the induced solo diagrams bear an acyclicity property that induces a faithful encoding into differential interaction nets. This gives a (new) proof that differential interaction nets are expressive enough to contain an encoding of the pi-calculus. All this is worked out in the case of finitary (replication free) systems without sum, match nor mismatch.",

	abstract="We address the problems of implementing the replication operator efficiently in the solos calculus --- a calculus of mobile processes without prefix. This calculus is expressive enough to admit an encoding of the whole fusion calculus and thus the $\pi$-calculus. We show that nested occurrences of replication can be avoided, that the size of replicated terms can be limited to three particles, and that the usual unfolding semantics of replication can be replaced by three simple reduction rules. To illustrate the results and show how the calculus can be efficiently implemented we present a graphic representation of agents in the solos calculus, adapting ideas from interaction diagrams and pi-nets.",
