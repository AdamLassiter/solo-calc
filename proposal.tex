\section{Problem Description}
\subsection{Current Problem}
As computer processor clock speeds have begun to stagnate in performance increase per year, manufacturers have begun to shift focus to multiple cores in search of greater performance. Supercomputers for decades have operated around the idea of clusters and massive parallelism. For this reason there is now more than ever a need to study the mathematical effects of concurrency in computation.

\subsection{Existing Solutions}
Similar to the $\lambda$-calculus of `single-threaded' computation, there exists $\pi$-calculus for the study of concurrent computation. While it provides the expressiveness required for Turing-completeness, it does not, however, lend itself to understandability nor clarity of the problem encoding.
There exist many further variants, such as the `Fusion Calculus' --- itself a superset of $\pi$-calculus --- and CSP (or communicating sequential processes). All of these excel in making the problem encoding more understandable, but at the cost of a more complicated language.

\subsection{Project Aims}
The project seeks to provide an implementation of both the `Solo Calculus', a model for which there exists an encoding of the $\pi$-calculus within itself, and also of `Solo Diagrams', an intuitively graphical representation of the calculus. These diagrams can then aid in understanding of reductions of process calculi, while maintaining a clean and simple language with strong proveable properties.

\subsection{Objectives}
Throughout the project, the following objectives and landmarks are hoped to be achieved:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Research current models of concurrency calculus and understand common use-cases and environments.
	\item Build a system capable of computing solo calculus expressions.
	\item Be able to convert expressions to diagrams.
	\item Visualise and interact with/modify diagrams and watch reductions step-by-step.
	\item Evaluate qualities of the system as a learning tool.
\end{itemize}


\section{Requirements Specification}
The following seeks to provide an estimate for the progress path the project will take, judging by initial research and planning. These are likely to evolve over time, as are priorities of each requirement (\textit{must $>$ should $>$ may $>$ might}).

\subsection{Solo Expressions}
The first functional part of the system will be focused on text-based Solo Expressions only. This will form a basis and backend to build upon to implement other features.
This system:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{Must} support input and output of text representing Solo Expressions.
	\item \textit{Must} be able to perform reductions on inputted expressions and return them.
	\item \textit{Should} provide this functionality through an accessible user interface.
	\item \textit{May} be implemented to evaluate expressions concurrently.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Solo Diagrams}
This will be the first extension of the system to allow interoperability with Solo Diagrams, an equivalent representation of the calculus, which has intuitive graphcal representations.
This system:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{Must} support input and output of said Solo Diagrams.
	\item \textit{Must} provide a conversion between Diagrams and Expressions.
	\item \textit{Should} be able to provide the same reductions as in the Expressions.
	\item \textit{May} be able to produce step-by-step reductions.
	\item \textit{Might} be implemented to evaluate diagrams concurrently.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Diagram Visualisation and Interaction}
The second extension will build on the previos to provide a graphical interface for input/output/manipulation of Solo Diagrams giving a clear visual representation of how the calculus works.
This system:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{Must} support visualisation of Solo Diagrams through a GUI\@.
	\item \textit{Must} support input/output of a (potentially manipulated) Diagram from/to an Expression.
	\item \textit{Should} support manipulation of a Diagram through use of the GUI only.
	\item \textit{Should} be user-friendly and provide and easier interface than text input.
	\item \textit{May} show step-by-step reductions of Diagrams.
\end{itemize}


\section{Project Plan}
\subsection{Phases}
The project will be broken down into the following stages, with each building on the previous. This allows flexibility if there is not enough time as an incomplete extension will still leave a working system.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Literature review
	\item Core system (Solo Expressions) implementation and unit testing
	\item Extension 1 (Solo Diagrams) implementation and integration testing
	\item Extension 2 (Graphical Visualisation) implementation and integration testing
	\item Analysis, write-up and conclusion
\end{enumerate}
